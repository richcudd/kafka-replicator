# kafka-replicator
###### shameless steal of Tom√°s Dias Almeida's kafka replicator repo but adapted to for testing across an environment using two networks
###### also examples do not use schema reg initially just to keep it simple

###### take the following steps
###### run up the environment
`docker-compose up -d

###### create the source topic and configure replicator
`./configure-replicator.sh

###### Produce some stuff:
`docker-compose exec srcKafka kafka-console-producer --bootstrap-server srcKafka:19092 --topic topic-test
`<send some messages, control-D to exit>

###### You should see them replicated on the dest side
###### You can look at the source Control Center via <ipaddress>:/19021
###### And you can look at the destination Control Center via <ipaddress>:/29021
###### This will confirm the copy and that everything is up and running ok
