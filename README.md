# kafka-replicator
Shameless steal of Tom√°s Dias Almeida's kafka replicator repo but adapted to for testing across an environment using two networks
also examples do not use schema reg initially just to keep it simple

### Take the following steps
#### Run up the environment:
`docker-compose up -d`

#### Create the source topic and configure replicator:
`./configure-replicator.sh`

#### Produce some stuff:
`docker-compose exec srcKafka kafka-console-producer --bootstrap-server srcKafka:19092 --topic topic-test`

`<send some messages, control-D to exit>`

#### Comments
You should see messages replicated on the dest side
You can look at the source Control Center via <ipaddress>:/19021
And you can look at the destination Control Center via <ipaddress>:/29021
This will confirm the copy and that everything is up and running ok

To have a look at the networks use the following command:

`docker network ls`

And to see the configuration on each use:

`docker network inspect ops_network`
